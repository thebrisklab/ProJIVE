# ProJIVE
Probabilistic JIVE

## The R script "PJIVE_ToyData" generates simulated data in the manner described in "Interpretive JIVE: Connections with CCA and an Application to Brain Connectivity." The functions that the script calls on are contained in "Functions_to_SimulateData" and require instillation of the "rootSolve" package to work.
